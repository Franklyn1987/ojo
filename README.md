Ojo - a fast and pretty image viewer. [pronounced 'oho']
========================================================


Ojo's goals:

1. Ojo's general goal is to become the best image viewer for photography-related work on Linux. To serve as the first step in organizing images.
1. It should start and show a single image as fast as possible - 90% of the time this is all that an image viewer is used for [it does now, need to keep it this way]
1. It should look great and be very unobstrusive when viewing images, so as not to distract from the main content
1. It should support RAW - this is lacking in most other images viewers. [it does now, for viewing, no export options]
1. It should be easy to quickly zoom-in to 100% to a certain part of the image. [we have zooming to 100% now and fit-to-window, but no other-finer grain zooming options]
1. It should provide some simple but convenient Trash, Copy and Move functionality. [nothing of these yet]

Ojo is based on these technologies: Python, GTK and HTML/JS/CSS in an embedded WebKit
